- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lohan3020, I've been a technology lover since I was a kid, I already had contact with java when I played minecraft, where I modified the launcher and put texts and images that I wanted. I'm currently in the seventh semester of agronomy, but I decided to take advantage of the vacation and started studying Python on 12/13/2022. I am simply fascinated with programming, I have plans to become a Python and full stack programmer. I hope one day to come back here on Github and change my bio to: Python and Full Stack Programmer.
